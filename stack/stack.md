# Stack 

## What is a Stack?
- A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.
- The last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

## Operations on a Stack
1. **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**: Remove and return the element at the top of the stack.
3. **Peek/Top**: Get the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty.
5. **size**: Get the number of elements in the stack.

## Stack Representation
- A stack can be visualized like a pile of plates where:
  - You add plates to the top.
  - You remove plates from the top.

## Stack Use Cases
- **Function Call Stack**: Tracks function calls in programming languages (recursion).
- **Undo/Redo Mechanism**: Used in text editors to store previous operations.

## Pros of Stack
- Simple to implement.
- Efficient for managing a sequence of elements with LIFO requirements.

## Cons of Stack
- Limited access: Only the top element is accessible.
- Fixed size in some implementations (e.g., array-based stack).

## Time Complexity 
- Push: O(1)
- Pop: O(1)
- Peek: O(1)
- isEmpty: O(1)
- size: O(1)
